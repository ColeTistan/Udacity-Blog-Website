# blog-website

This is a project that requires you to utilize your `HTML` and `CSS` skills to build out a personal blog website, including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, you'll work to appropriately structure your files, as well as use flexbox and CSS Grid systems to build a page mobile responsive.

## Technologies Used
- `HTML5`
- `CSS3`

## Instructions 
1) Download zip file from this repository and extract data.
2) Run project on the internet browser of your choice.

## Notes
- Only the first blog post has a page redirection, the rest are dummy posts.
- There are two `HTML` files: `index.html` & `blog.html`.
- The CSS file, `style.css`, organizes various stylesheets by importing them.
